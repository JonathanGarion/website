		I’m not really sure how old I was when I got the gift for Christmas, but I remember thinking it was a pretty impressive
		piece of electronic hardware. It was really cool looking (technologically speaking), and I was awfully proud to own it. It
		certainly made for lots of fun times.
		What was this high-tech gift, you ask? Why, it was a tape recorder! It was a monographic, reel to reel tape deck that
		came with it’s own plug-in microphone. I could hold that mic up to my transistor radio’s speaker and record songs onto
		tape. I could also play the guitar and sing and record every second of it. I could even hide and record conversations from
		unsuspecting family members. I was in recording heaven!
		Years later I owned an 8 track stereo recording deck (ok, that was a mistake). At another point in time I had a stereo
		cassette recording deck that would physically flip the tape over when one side was finished recording or playing. Now I
		own a more conventional stereo dual cassette deck, but I no longer use it for recording or much of anything else for that
		matter.
